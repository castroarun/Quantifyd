## Post

Launching 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲𝐝 - the running chapter!

Stocks and personal finances — it's the one topic nobody brings up.

Too personal. Too niche. Too judgemental. So everyone quietly figures out their own maze.

Most of us are taught to buy low — find "undervalued" stocks, wait for them to recover. And then do something worse — cut winners short, feed that capital to the losers, and call it "smart rebalancing." That's not discipline. That's rewarding what isn't working.

I don't buy stocks that are falling. I buy stocks that are 𝐚𝐥𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠.

I ride my winners. I don't worry about the portfolio being skewed. Strength deserves more capital, not less.

I'm making over 𝟒𝟎% 𝐗𝐈𝐑𝐑 on equity portfolio.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐈 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰:
✅ Buy stocks hitting all-time high breakouts
✅ Topline & profits — positive AND growing
✅ Debt-to-equity ≤ 0.20
✅ ROE & ROCE ≥ 15%
✅ Operating margins better than peers and/or rising

I then tried "quant"ifying this — tweaking a few rules for automation. Added a mechanical exit: stock drops 20% from peak → out, capital redeployed to the next winner. No hope, no holding.

Backtested across 𝟐𝟎 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 of Indian market data — Nifty 500 universe, through 2008 GFC, COVID, every correction:

𝐂𝐀𝐆𝐑: ~29% (system) vs ~13% (Nifty 50)

→ ₹1 Crore in Nifty 50 (buy & hold) → ₹11.5 Crore
→ ₹1 Crore using momentum + quality → ₹𝟏𝟓𝟖 𝐂𝐫𝐨𝐫𝐞

Same capital. Same market. Same 20 years. 𝟏𝟒𝐱 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞.

𝐃𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐃:
Nifty 50 fell 39%. This system fell 34% — trailing exits removed stocks mechanically and shuttled capital into debt funds and ETFs before the full damage hit.

People overcomplicate investing. Research on fund managers and funds rather than the businesses themselves. The best system isn't the most sophisticated — it's a few clear rules you actually follow.

Just data. Just discipline.

This momentum + quality engine is just the core. I've layered 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 tactical strategies on top — mean reversion, breakout overlays — each working independently so when one is flat, another is firing. Combined CAGR: 𝟑𝟐%.
